## How many hamlets are cluster-associated?

```{r}
right <- pd_moz$minicensus_main %>%
  group_by(code = hh_hamlet_code) %>%
  summarise(households = n(),
            people = sum(hh_member_num))
j <- left_join(hamlet_level, right)
```

Mozambique has `r nrow(hamlet_level)` hamlets. Of these, `r length(which(!is.na(hamlet_level$clusters_in_hamlet)))` have at least one cluster associated with them. 

## How many households are in cluster-associated hamlets?

Were we to cense the entire district, we would expect `r sum(pd_moz$minicensus_main$hh_member_num)` people and `r sum(j$households, na.rm = T)` households. If we were to include only those households in hamlets with >0 associated clusters, we would anticipate `r sum(j$people[!is.na(j$clusters_in_hamlet)])` people and `r sum(j$households[!is.na(j$clusters_in_hamlet)], na.rm = TRUE)` households.

The below table shows one row for each hamlet, with columns indicating the cluster status, number of households, and number of people



```{r}
bohemia::prettify(j, nrows = nrow(j), 
                  download_options = TRUE)

## Distribution of number of clusters per hamlet

```{r}
ggplot(data = j,
       aes(x = clusters_in_hamlet)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = 'Clusters in hamlet',
       y = 'Hamlets')
```


## Distribution of number of hamlets per cluster

  geom_bar() +

       y = 'Clusters')
